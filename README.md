# Stantion
A Simplistic Monte Carlo Simulation Engine as an Eiffel Library

## Background
A stantion is urban slang for a STalker + fAN (STAN) or a "stalker fan" or someone who is obsessed with someone or something. I am personally obsessed with the book, "How to Measure Anything" by Douglas Hubbard. This book has been the inspiration for the Rialize and Foggler products. Not only does Rialize has the capacity to measure work being done by you simply doing work, but from that data it will soon start to be able to make risk analysis predictions to answer questions like, "When will I finish this work?" or "What is the estimated completion date of this work?" So, because of the execellence of all this material, I am going to be a STAN (Stantion) of this Monte Carlo Simulation Engine over the coming weeks!

## Simplistic?
Yes, simplistic. I am not a math guy. I do not pretend to be. I am writing this library in the simplest and most direct way that I can to accomplish the risk analysis and prediction needs of Rialize and Foggler. This library is not intended to be used by math people for math reasons. It only goal is the purpose stated here.
