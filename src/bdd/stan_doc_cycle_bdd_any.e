class STAN_DOC_CYCLE_BDD_ANY
--	This root class is generated code. DO NOT CHANGE!

--		Inherit from this class in your project to indicate
--		that the ancestor class is somehow related to the BDD
--		specification that generated this class. This is the 
--		basis for the Rialize product to do Monte Carlo risk 
--		analysis and answer questions like, "How likely is it
--		that this BDD FP speciation will not finish on-time?"
